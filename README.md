# React + Vite

I've built a simple portfolio website using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. This project showcases my skills and projects, featuring smooth animations and responsive design to create a modern and user-friendly experience. The website is fully responsive and optimized for various devices, offering a dynamic way to present my work and expertise in web development.
